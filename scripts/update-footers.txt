Files to update with SiteFooter component:

1. /vercel/share/v0-project/app/modes/regie/page.tsx - DONE (conseil already done)
2. /vercel/share/v0-project/app/business-units/banque-finance/page.tsx
3. /vercel/share/v0-project/app/business-units/ingenierie/page.tsx
4. /vercel/share/v0-project/app/expertises/cloud/page.tsx
5. /vercel/share/v0-project/app/expertises/sap/page.tsx
6. /vercel/share/v0-project/app/expertises/software-engineering/page.tsx
7. /vercel/share/v0-project/app/expertises/gestion-projet/page.tsx
8. /vercel/share/v0-project/app/expertises/infrastructure-devops/page.tsx

Pattern to replace:
From: {/* Footer */} <footer>...</footer>
To: <SiteFooter />

Also need to add import: import { SiteFooter } from "@/components/site-footer"
